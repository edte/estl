// Allocates size bytes of uninitialized storage.
// If allocation succeeds, returns a pointer that is suitably
// aligned for any object type with fundamental alignment.
// If size is zero, the behavior of malloc is implementation-defined.
// For example, a null pointer may be returned. Alternatively,
// a non-null pointer may be returned; but such a pointer should
// not be dereferenced, and should be passed to free to avoid memory
// leaks.
//  malloc is thread-safe: it behaves as though only accessing the
// memory locations visible through its argument, and not any static
// storage.
// A previous call to free or realloc that deallocates a region of
// memory synchronizes-with a call to malloc that allocates the same
// or a part of the same region of memory. This synchronization occurs
// after any access to the memory by the deallocating function and
// before any access to the memory by malloc. There is a single total
// order of all allocation and deallocation functions operating on
// each particular region of memory.

// @c:
// void *malloc(size_t size)

// @Parameters:
// size âˆ’ This is the size of the memory block, in bytes.
//
// @Return Value:
// This function returns a pointer to the allocated memory,
// or NULL if the request fails.

// that may not be used to access storage)
// calloc is thread-safe: it behaves as though only accessing the
// memory locations visible through its argument, and not any static

// A previous call to free or realloc that deallocates a region of

// Reallocates the given area of memory. It must be previously

// The reallocation is done by either:
// a) expanding or contracting the existing area pointed to by ptr,
// if possible. The contents of the area remain unchanged up to the
// lesser of the new and old sizes. If the area is expanded, the
// contents of the new part of the array are undefined.
// b) allocating a new memory block of size new_size bytes, copying
// memory area with size equal the lesser of the new and the old sizes, and freeing the old block.
// If there is not enough memory, the old memory block is not freed
// and null pointer is returned.
// If ptr is NULL, the behavior is the same as calling malloc(new_size).
// If new_size is zero, the behavior is implementation defined (null
// pointer may be returned (in which case the old memory block may or
// may not be freed), or some non-null pointer may be returned that
// may not be used to access storage). Such usage is deprecated

// The behavior is undefined if the memory area referred to by ptr has
// already been deallocated, that is, free() or realloc() has already
// been called with ptr as the argument and no calls to malloc(),
// calloc() or realloc() resulted in a pointer equal to ptr afterwards.
